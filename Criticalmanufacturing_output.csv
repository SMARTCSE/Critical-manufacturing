One MES for 10 Research Institutes,https://www.criticalmanufacturing.com/insights/case-studies/one-mes-for-10-research-institutes/,"How FMD is Standardizing to Streamline Microelectronics Progress For the first time, 13 institutes from the two research organizations, Fraunhofer and Leibniz, are combining their expertise under one virtual umbrella. With more than 2,000 scientists, the FMD is one the world’s largest R&D network in the field of micro- and nanoelectronics. To accelerate the progress, FMD has embarked on FMD-Digital to unify onto a single MES. As research institutes, many aspects are different in the FMD fabs than in typical semiconductor production fabs. Critical Manufacturing MES, allowing configuration of the system to meet the needs of each fab and covering the critical advanced scenarios, is delivering a wide array of benefits. Cooperation and accelerated learning among the institutes is one major win.

A step to the future of manufacturing,https://www.criticalmanufacturing.com/insights/case-studies/ultradent-case-study/,"MES to manage extreme vertical integration at Ultradent Products Inc.  Case Study Traceability, genealogy, and material handling are crucial for Medical Device manufacturing operations. After 40 years of using paper-based systems, Ultradent, a global dental manufacturing company, made the strategic decision to implement an intelligent Manufacturing Execution System to drive efficiency and quality, including fully electronic batch records (eBR). Ultradent recognized that they had to address three very important challenges to align the MES with their strategic objectives: Be very clear on the key benefits of the project and how to measure success Decide on a sustainable project approach and methodology for scaling Educate key stakeholders
Read this case study to understand the scope of the project, and get Ultradent’s advice on how to deliver a successful MES project."
Scaling with One MES to Replace 50+ Legacy Systems,https://www.criticalmanufacturing.com/insights/case-studies/scaling-with-one-mes-to-replace-50-legacy-systems/,"Vishay's Passives take action to be fit for the future Vishay, a Fortune 100 company, has grown by acquisition and now manufacturers one of the world’s largest portfolios of semiconductors and passive electronic components. The breadth of products is beneficial to customers, but the internal result has been enormous diversity and complexity in the IT landscape, processes and ways of working. Vishay embarked on a program to standardize and harmonize systems across over 30 plants, and in 2018, began moving towards a single Manufacturing Execution System (MES). Their analysis showed that core MES functionality could replace over 50 systems, not including quality, scheduling, or maintenance, which the new MES can also provide. Read this case study to learn how the implementation of Critical Manufacturing MES, at a multi-line plant in the US, is helping Vishay to become more cost-effective and efficient and accelerate their progress towards Industry 4.0.

Radiating Manufacturing Data for a Healthy Business,https://www.criticalmanufacturing.com/insights/case-studies/radiating-manufacturing-data-for-a-healthy-business-how-the-modern-mes-helps-elekta-grow/,"Speedy, precise, cost-effective and efficient: How the modern MES helps Elekta grow. Back in 2017, Elekta, a pioneer in Precision Radiation Medice that has revolutionized cancer care with precise and tailored radiotherapy treatments, looked at the business value of implementing a Manufacturing Execution System (MES). They have since implemented Critical Manufacturing’s modern MES across three manufacturing sites in The Netherlands, UK and China. Elekta needed the MES to support its strategic business priorities and the project realized specific improvements in quality, manufacturing lead times, supply chain performance, lean manufacturing, and employee engagement. Read this case study to understand how the implementation of Critical Manufacturing MES has enabled Elekta to eliminate paper, optimize processes, significantly reduce the cost of poor quality and contextualize data from all manufacturing areas into a single source of truth, among other benefits.

This case study showcases Critical Manufacturing MES selection factors by Austria Technologie & Systemtechnik Aktiengesellschaft (AT&S), a leader in the high-end printed circuit board (PCB) market, and the main aspects considered in the project."
Auto Components Growth Drives to MES with a Future,https://www.criticalmanufacturing.com/insights/case-studies/auto-components-growth-drives-to-mes-with-a-future-robust-control-for-yazaki-saltano-molding/,"Robust Control for Yazaki Saltano Molding This Case study describes the Critical Manufacturing MES implementation process at the Portuguese facility of Yazaki Group, a leading supplier of wire, cable and wiring harnesses for automotive OEMs. This was Yazaki’s second chance at implementing MES after an unsuccessful attempt several years before, when a project failed due to the vendor not being able to set up a reliable machine connection. As a result, the data was unreliable and employees stopped using the system. Critical Manufacturing successfully replaced the manual system and then connected dozens of existing and new molding machines in the second-phase of the MES project. Since then, Yazaki has expanded, adding more machines every month, without the need for additional operators."
